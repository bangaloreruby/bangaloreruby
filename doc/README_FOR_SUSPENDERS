Installation
------------

First install the suspenders gem:

    gem install suspenders

Then run:

    suspenders create projectname

This will create a Rails 3 app in `projectname'. This script creates a new
new git repository. It is not meant to be used against an existing repo.

Suspenders uses [Trout](https://github.com/thoughtbot/trout) to make it
easier to maintain a base version of special files (like Gemfile) in
Suspenders.

Whenever you want to get the latest and greatest Suspenders' Gemfile, run:

    trout update Gemfile
